title:  OpenADS - BellyGraph - Implement a scalable data-structure to model evolving graphs
description: <p>BellyGraph is a novel query framework built for evolving graphs, currently sketch based summarization techniques (e.g TCM) are implemented, and graph degree distribution is approximated across streaming graph relations. Idea is to extend the current data-structure to more scalable version which can deal with both online and offline analysis of evolving graphs.</p><p>BellyGraph is directly connected with OpenADS -- which is a Big Data analytics framework designed to consume and monitor network traffic and mine hidden anomalies using advanced machine learning techniques. In current date, OpenADS is still at it's conceptual stage where it is designed to work at a massive scale. The system believes to act as an extensible and reliable platform to enrich traditional Intrusion Detection System (IDS). OpenADS is unique at it's nature with the architecture supported by Berkeley Data Stack (BDS). <a href="https://github.com/scorelab/OpenADS/wiki" target="_blank">OpenADS Wiki</a></p>
