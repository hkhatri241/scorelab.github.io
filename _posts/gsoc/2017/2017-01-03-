title:  Drola - Drone with Lora
description: <p>Drones use their radio link to communicate with their ground stations and controllers. Those radio links can communicate for a limited range. When a drone fly automatically through way points it may go away from radio link. Then ground station unable to monitor that drone any more. We want a system to monitor automatically flying drones using long range communication network “LORA” . Its mandatory to uniquely identifying each drone, for that we want to bind unique key to each drone. The final product should be a separate unit which can externally mound on any kind of drone.</p>
