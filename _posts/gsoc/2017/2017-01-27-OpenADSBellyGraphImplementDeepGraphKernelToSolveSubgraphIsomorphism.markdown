title:  OpenADS - BellyGraph - Implement deep graph kernel to solve subgraph isomorphism
description: <p>Subgraph isomorphism asks if there is a subset of edges and vertices of G1 that is isomorphic to a smaller graph G2, decision version is NP-complete.</p><p>Known polynomial alternative - Graph kernels which compare substructures of graphs that are computable in polynomial time. (e.g. Graphlet kernels, Weisfeiler-Lehman subtree kernels, and Shortest-Path graph kernels.)</p><p>This project is inspired by deep learning approaches, to learn latent representations of sub-structures for graphs, and implement the deep learning notions in a scalable kernel model.</p>
